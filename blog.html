 Hi, I am struggling to pass the 3rd level. Are there any strategies to beat it√â 
<br>
Game creator: Our game is not quite based on strategy and more on skill, so you can practice and keep on re-doing the level and once you have mastered it you can move on to the next one.
<br>
Liam: Hi, I am looking to buy a new game, would this game be a good fit for me?
<br>
Game creator: It really depends on what kind of games you like to play, our game is more of a skill based game where you are platforming which progessively gets harder with each level. 
<br>
Liam: Ok, I will make sure to try it out.
<br>
Nathan: Hi, I am wondering how hard this game is?
<br>
Game creator:  This game progessively gets harder with each level.  So the first level is really easy and is there just to teach you the mechanics but after that the game gets much harder
